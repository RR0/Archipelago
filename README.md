The Archipelago project aims to solve the problem of data access and sharing by building a meta layer over databases that will enable the user to access data without depending on their underlying structures or technologies.

See its [Wiki](https://github.com/Javarome/Archipelago/wiki).

## TypeScript implementation

This branch is about a TypeScript implementation of Archipelago as a web server.

It allows to browse a metamodel and how its fields are mapped to the underlying databases.
