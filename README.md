The Archipelago project aims to solve the problem of data access and sharing by building a meta layer over databases
that will enable the user to access data without depending on their underlying structures or technologies.

See its [Wiki](https://github.com/Javarome/Archipelago/wiki).

## Java implementation

This branch is about a Java implementation of Archipelago as a standalone application using a Swing UI.

It allows to browse a metamodel and how its fields are mapped to the underlying databases.

See the [TypeScript](https://github.com/RR0/Archipelago/tree/java) branch for a standalone app implementation.
