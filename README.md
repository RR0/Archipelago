The Archipelago project aims to solve the problem of data access and sharing by building a meta layer over databases that will enable the user to access data without depending on their underlying structures or technologies.

See its [Wiki](https://github.com/Javarome/Archipelago/wiki).

## TypeScript implementation

This branch is about a TypeScript implementation of Archipelago as a web server.

It allows to browse a metamodel and how its fields are mapped to the underlying databases.

See the [Java branch](https://github.com/RR0/Archipelago/tree/java) for a web server implementation.

The Archipelago project was [presented as a poster](https://github.com/RR0/Archipelago/blob/master/doc/Poster-CAIPAN2.pdf) at CAIPAN II, an UAP event held by CNES at Toulouse in late 2022.

Since 2024 the database aggregation system devised by Archipelago is being implemented as [part of the RR0 project](https://github.com/RR0/rr0.org/tree/master/time/datasource).
