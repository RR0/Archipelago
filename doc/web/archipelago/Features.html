<h2>Customizable data model</h2>
<p>The goal of Archipelago is not only to provide the user a unified view of existing ufological databases, but also to allow him/her to browse and manipulate a model that suit its own needs and constraints. For this reason the <a href="Metadata.html">meta model</a> can be user specific, or shared among multiple users/groups.</p>
<h2>Data merging</h2>
<p>When retrieving data from different sources, Archipelago can reach one of the following conclusions and actions :</p>
<ul>
<li>the data are different
<ul>
<li>they relate to the same event
<ul>
<li>different data have different semantics
<ul>
<li>add them </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>different data have the same semantics
<ul>
<li>try merge them
<ul>
<li>they can be merged</li>
<li>they cannot be merged
<ul>
<li>add them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>they relate to different events
<ul>
<li>add them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the data are the same
<ul>
<li>we merge them  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Customized processes</h2>
<p>The user must be able to apply its own <a href="Processes.html">processes</a> to the data represented by the meta model. Such <a href="Processes.html">processes</a> are typically tied to a given meta model and can be shared along with this model. </p>
<h2>Exchange</h2>
<p>Archipelago allow users to retrieve data from existing <a href="Database.html">data sources</a>, but nothing prevent such sources to be other Archipelago servers. As a result, data can be shared between meta models that map one to each other. </p>
<h2>Internationalization</h2>
<p>The information must be displayed to the user as conveniently as possible. For this reason, Archipelago adapts its user interface to the user's language. Furthermore, it can try to display data contents using the most suitable langage for the user, when translations are available. </p>
